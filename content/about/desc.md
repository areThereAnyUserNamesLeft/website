I began writing Go professionally in 2018 after several years as a web / App developer with a background in Linux, NodeJS, Delphi and Python.

This
blog is just some fun so I can look back and see where I started in Golang and some of my thoughts along the way. If you
come accross it I hope my experiences help you.

``` go
func mkBlog() (b *blog, err Error){
    // Worry about content later...
    return
}
```
##### The above function pretty much sums up the begining...
